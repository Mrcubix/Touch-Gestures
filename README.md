# Touch Gestures For OpenTabletDriver (WIP)

The goal of this project is to build a foundation on how gestures should be handled accross all versions of OpenTabletDriver, until touch is officially supported.

This gesture system is in no way final, there is so much that could be improved and optimized.
Unfortunately, i do not have the necessary knowledge to properly do so, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
